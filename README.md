# Dashboard Assignment

This project is a modern web application built with a robust and popular tech stack, focusing on performance, maintainability, and a rich user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
- **Vite**: A fast and opinionated build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Shadcn/ui**: A collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable bear-bones state-management solution.
- **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Powerful asynchronous state management for React.
- **Recharts**: A composable charting library built with React and D3.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- **Radix UI**: A low-level UI component library for building accessible design systems.
- **Lucide React**: A beautiful, customizable icon library.
- **date-fns**: A modern JavaScript date utility library.
- **Embla Carousel React**: A barebones carousel library.
- **React Simple Maps**: Declarative react components for building interactive maps.

## Approach

The project follows a component-driven development approach, leveraging React's ecosystem for building modular and reusable UI components. TypeScript is used extensively to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability. Vite provides a fast development server and optimized builds. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui are utilized for a streamlined and consistent styling experience, enabling rapid UI development. State management is handled with Zustand for simplicity and performance, while React Query manages server-side data fetching and caching. React Router DOM handles client-side routing, and Recharts is used for data visualization within the dashboard. Zod is integrated for robust form validation and data schema definition.
